## 📝 Project Overview

**Worksout** is a complete **MERN stack freelancing platform** built to simulate real-world freelance systems. Users can **sign in via Firebase**, create and manage tasks, form companies, post jobs, and bid on others' job posts.

Each company maintains its own job listings, where users can view all bids related to a specific job. Jobs are **automatically sorted by deadline**, ensuring those with the nearest deadlines are shown first. Each post includes its **creation date** and **deadline**, providing clarity and easy management for all users.

The main goal of this project was to design a realistic full-stack web application and understand the thought process, structure, and problem-solving required to build such a system.
